## Effect on those fighting

### The Charge of the Light Brigade

Death and serious injury is what the soldiers fighting face.

The morbid repetition of phrases like "*valley of Death*" and "*mouth of Hell*" creates an ominous mood and tells the reader that there is no escape for the soldiers.

There is a focus on the loss of life in the charge, this is seen by how each stanza ends with a reference to the "*six hundred*" this reminds the reader of the cost of the charge.

The poem also highlights the soldiers bravery in how they will do their job even though the know there fate.

### Remains

The looters in the poem are dehumanised by the soldiers as they try and show killing as part of their job. This is shown by the unreliable tone of the poem "*On another occasion*".

Colloquial verbs "*tosses*" and "*carted off*" show how the soldiers casually dispose of the body. This shows that conflict has the power to devalue a human life and make violence seem normal.

However the conflict does leaves a psychological impact on the soldier which he can't "*flush*" out.

Then final stanza of the poem changes from the normal 4 lines down to 2 this shows the soldier's breakdown

## Effect on those not fighting

### Poppies

The poem has a focus on the pain and distress experienced by the mother whose son has joined the army.

Even before he leaves the mother feels detached from him, the "*gelled... blackthorns*" of his hair refuse to let her fingers run through it. This foreshadows the physical separation they will endure.

When he leaves the mother is anxious, she fears for his safety this is seen in how she describes her stomach as "*busy.. making tucks, darts pleats*".

### War Photographer

There is a contrast between how the photographer hands are steady when taking the pictures, but when he goes to develop them his hand "*tremble*". This shows that he is has been a deeply affected by the "*hundred agonies*" he has seen.

His view of home is also affected by what he has seen, the "*ordinary pain*" of England contrasts starkly with the "*running children in nightmare heat*" in the war zone.
