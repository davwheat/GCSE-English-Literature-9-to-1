# Identity

## Overview

- Belonging to a family is a important part of human identity.
- National identity and patriotism can have powerful effects, especially in war.

### Family Identity is important

#### Poppies

The boy's identity as a son is clearly established in the poem, his mother smooths down his collar and says how they used to "play at... being Eskimos" when he was younger.

However the son has a new identity as a soldier, his "blazer" is a visual reminder of this.

The mother moving from his bedroom to the "war memorial" reflects this change, the bedroom is a symbol of family identity, but the memorial symbolises his new identity.

The mother still clings to his identity as her son and the poem ends with her trying to hear his "playground voice", he's still her child and she cannot wait for him to return.

#### Tissue

The opening three stanzas explore the importance of family history and heritage, there's a reference to recording family histories in "the back of the Koran".

These pages are treasured, they are "smoothed and stroked", almost as if they were living things.

The repetition of this phrase later in the poem, in reference to the "grand design" of a human body, shows how important family history and heritage is in forming a identity.

### National identity and patriotism has a large influence on people

#### Checking Out Me History

The speaker feels that his identity has been shaped too much by British national identity.

He believes that learning about key people in Caribbean history will help develop his true identity.

The poem ends with the speaker's assertion the he is "carving out me history". This highlights that he intends to continue learning, "carving" hints at a difficult process with a permanent result.

#### Kamikaze

National identity often becomes more important in war. Japanese saw it as a great honour to be a kamikaze and die for their country.

The "incantations" that fill the pilot's head may refer to the patriotic propaganda used to promote national identity.

The end of the poem shows the tension between the family identity and national identity. For the pilot the family identity was more important, but the family's patriotism was so strong that they treated him as if he was dead.

### Other poems
