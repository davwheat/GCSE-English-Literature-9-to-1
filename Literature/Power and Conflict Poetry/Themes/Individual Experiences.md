# Individual Experiences

## Overview

- Conflicts can involve thousands of people, however everyone involved will have a different experience.
- Focusing on one person's experience allows the poet to present a place, action or event from a unique point of view.

## Conflict can leave people feeling isolated

### Bayonet Charge

There are no other soldiers in the poem, suggesting the soldier is isolated and alone.

The only other living thing is a "yellow hare" that crawls "in a threshing circle". Showing only one animal further shows the soldier's isolation and emphasise how far he is from any help or comfort.

The soldier feels he is insignificant in the "cold clockwork of the stars and the nations". He understands he is part of a wider picture however he feels completely isolated from it.

### War Photographer

The photographer is described as being "finally alone" which suggests that he needs space and quiet to reflect on what he has experienced, but also his guilt about being able to escape the "suffering".

His isolation in the war zone is enlarged by the face that it's a "strangers features" he photographs, and how he seeks approval "without words", despite the fact he is recording peoples suffering he does not share in it, which ultimately distances him from it.

The quote "they do not care" highlights how different he feels from everyone else, the elusiveness of who "they" are hints that he feels isolated from the rest of the world.

## Individuals have unique experiences of places

### London

The use of "I" at the start of the poem is dramatic monologue describing a walk in London.

The speaker appears to be isolated from the suffering he seems, which allows him to observe and comment on the bigger picture. This allows him to recognise the "mind-forged manacles" that trap people.

The speaker's description of the city is entirely negative, which makes the reader question whether he's biased. Even when he experiences the joys of a wedding he can only see a funeral "the marriage hearse".

### The Prelude

The narrator is alone in his "act of stealth" as he steals the boat, when the mountain frightens him, he describes it in personal terms, claiming the mountain "strode after me". This personification suggests that he feels nature is reacting to him as a individual.

He describes the effect the event on him as "solitude .. or blank desertion", showing how the event has left him isolated and alone.

His ideas on nature have also been changed he is left feeling insignificant compared with the "huge and might forms" of nature.
