# Memory

## Overview

- Memories can be powerful, particularly memories of negative or difficult experiences.
- Memories often contain specific, personal details which give them a unique power.

### Memories can have haunting effect

#### Remains

The speaker is haunted by the memory of killing the looter. Going home doesn't help him, his sleep is disturbed and he can't "flush him" (the memory) out, even with any amount of "drink" or "drugs".

The monosyllabic, punchy line openings of "sleep" and "dream" imitate the loud, violent sounds of bullet shots, and reflect the way that he jolted awake at night by memories of the killing.

The metaphor of a soldier "dug in behind enemy lines" emphasises how the memory is stuck in his mind, and hints at the danger of the memory, it has the potential to destroy him.

#### War Photographer

The haunting memories are trigged by the development of a photo in his darkroom.

Senses are used to describe the memories, he heard "the cries... of the man's wife" and seeing the "blood stained" in the dust. This makes them seem personal and vivid in his mind.

The way that his hands "tremble" suggest that remembering the scenes is hard for him, the memories of conflict seem to affect him more the events they are from.

### Memories can also be described vividly

#### The Emigr√©e

The speaker vividly remembers the city she left as a child. She describes her view of it as "bright, filled paper weight", which highlights how positive and wonderful this place was.

Different senses increase the vividness, her "child's vocabulary" "tastes of sunlight" and she combs the personified city's "hair".

However there's hints that the memories are not reliable, the perfect place she remembers might be "at war" or "sick with tyrants".

#### Kamikaze

The daughter imagines that the pilot's idyllic childhood memories contributed to him turning around.

The beautiful descriptions of sea creatures hint at the power of the pilot's childhood memories.

Metaphors like the "loose silver of whitebait" create a powerful, sensual picture.

This creates a contrast to the daughter's memories of life after her father returned. They are presented in a matter-of-fact way, her straightforward language "my mother never spoke again" highlights how painful the situation was.

### Other poems
