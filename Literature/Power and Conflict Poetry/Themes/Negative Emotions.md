## Anger aimed at society

### London

The narrator is angry about the society he sees as walks the streets of London.

The use of rhetorical devices gets the reader to share his anger. The repetition of "marks" and "every" and the use of emotive imagery "ever infant's cry of fear" is an example of this.

The images of the "black'ning church" and "blood down the palace walls" shows his anger at institutions like the Church and the government/monarchy for not improving things.

### Checking Out Me History

The speaker is angry at British society for giving him a biased eduction in his own country.

The repetition of "Dem tell me" is used to set himself ("me") in clear opposition to society ("Dem").

He even avoids British grammar to distance himself from the society.

His anger leads him to juxtapose the British pantomime and nursery rhyme characters "Dick whittington and he cat", with Caribbean heroes "Toussaint L'Ouverture".

He has made these comparisons ridiculous on purpose to emphasise his frustration with "Dem".

## Guilt as a result of war

### Remains

The soldiers guilt seems to come from his doubt as to whether the looter was truly a threat. The repetition of "probably armed, possibly not" shows that he is replaying the events to try and work out if his actions were justified.

The guilt eats at the soldier, he says the dead man is "here in my head when I close my eyes".

The potential reference to Lady Macbeth in the final line hints the guilt is driving the soldier mad.

The shift of voice from first person plural "we" to first person singular "I" shows that the soldier believes he is personally responsible for the death.

### War Photographer

There is a sense that he photographer feels guilty about the ease of life in England. The phrase "Ordinary pain which simple weather can dispel", shows how different life in England is to the war zone.

He refers to taking the picture as doing "what someone must". There's a sense of guilt in his words, he knows that taking photographs may seem insensitive, but he feels a duty to show the world their suffering.
